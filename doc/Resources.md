## Tools

### **Unity and Visual Studio**

You get the option to install Visual Studio Community 2017 when you install Unity. I recommend you install Visual Studio this way if you don't already have it.

You should use the Unity Hub app to download Unity. Unity Hub makes it easy to keep track on your projects and your different Unity versions.

The version I will be using in the course is **Unity version 2018.3.0**

### **Sourcetree**

I use Sourcetree as a GUI client for Git. It's easy to use and is well supported. You will learn all you need to know about it in the course.
