~~A deep knowledge on software development and game development~~ **None.**

## Outcome

You will be able to read and write your own software using Unity as a basis for actually seeing stuff happening! You will know enough C# _(The programming language)_ to write your own software! Finally you will be able to develop your own game.

In short, this is what you will learn to:

- Read and understand C# code.
- Write your own software using C# and Unity!
- Use Github to version control your code - very useful.
- Use Unity to create your own game.

## Actual prerequisites

You'll need a computer which is powerful enough to run Unity and the dedication to learn new stuff!

### **The inconvenient truth**

Learning a new language is difficult! Learning to speak it _right_ is even worse. This course has a big focus on writing actual production ready code which you won't be empareseed to show to a potential employer. You will learn best practices and the conventions used by Microsoft who developed the C# language and the underlying .NET framework.
