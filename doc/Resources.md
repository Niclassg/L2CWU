## Tools

### **Unity and Visual Studio**

You get the option to install Visual Studio Community 2017 when you install Unity. I recommend you install Visual Studio this way if you don't already have it.

You should use the Unity Hub app to download Unity. Unity Hub makes it easy to keep track on your projects and your different Unity versions.

- Download Unity Hub here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

The version I will be using in the course is **Unity version 2018.3.0**

### **Sourcetree**

I use Sourcetree as a GUI client for Git. It's easy to use and is well supported. You will learn all you need to know about it in the course.

## Accounts

You will need a Github account if you want to follow all steps when learning to use Git along with Sourcetree.

Creating a Unity account will also be nessesary if you want to include Unity Ads and other Unity services in your game.
